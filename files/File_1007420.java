/**
 * <p>
 * The PathPair is used for the windows watcher implementation. In ntfs the
 * watched directories are locked so deleting them is impossible. The windows
 * watcher watches one directory down ( at the expense of getting many more
 * events) and this class holds the mapping between the <code>target</code>
 * directory (the one we intend to listen events) vs the actually
 * <code>watched</code> directory.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This workaround, does not completely eliminate the locking problem. For
 * example, when working with maven projects one first needs to clean and then
 * build (two commands).
 *
 * In eclipse, sometimes the m2e plugin complains that it can not access
 * generated files. This is usually fixed with a clean.
