/** 
 * Projects the  {@link Vector3} given in world space to screen coordinates. It's the same as GLU gluProject with one smalldeviation: The viewport is assumed to span the whole screen. The screen coordinate system has its origin in the <b>bottom</b> left, with the y-axis pointing <b>upwards</b> and the x-axis pointing to the right. This makes it easily useable in conjunction with  {@link Batch} and similar classes. This method allows you to specify the viewport position anddimensions in the coordinate system expected by  {@link GL20#glViewport(int,int,int,int)}, with the origin in the bottom left corner of the screen.
 * @param viewportX the coordinate of the bottom left corner of the viewport in glViewport coordinates.
 * @param viewportY the coordinate of the bottom left corner of the viewport in glViewport coordinates.
 * @param viewportWidth the width of the viewport in pixels
 * @param viewportHeight the height of the viewport in pixels
 * @return the mutated and projected worldCoords {@link Vector3}
