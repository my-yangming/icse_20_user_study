 * Because this method throws an unchecked exception, when it is called in a method with a return type the compiler does not know the method is exiting, requiring a further line to return null or throw an unchecked exception directly. This generified method allows this to be avoided by tricking the compiler by adding a return statement as so: <pre> String someMethod() { try { somethingThatThrowsException(); } catch (Exception e) { return throwUnchecked(e, String.class); // does not actually return, throws the exception } } </pre>
 * @param ex The exception that will be thrown, unwrapped and unchecked
 * @param returnType trick to persuade the compiler that a method returns appropriately
 * @return Never returns, always throws the passed in exception
