/** 
 * Function to translate a point given in screen coordinates to world space. It's the same as GLU gluUnProject but does not rely on OpenGL. The viewport is assumed to span the whole screen and is fetched from  {@link Graphics#getWidth()} and{@link Graphics#getHeight()}. The x- and y-coordinate of vec are assumed to be in screen coordinates (origin is the top left corner, y pointing down, x pointing to the right) as reported by the touch methods in  {@link Input}. A z-coordinate of 0 will return a point on the near plane, a z-coordinate of 1 will return a point on the far plane.
 * @param screenCoords the point in screen coordinates
 * @return the mutated and unprojected screenCoords {@link Vector3}
