This may or may not be OK for you, and you should understand exactly how this works. Each exchange can either 1) rely on the hard-coded json file that comes packaged with XChange's jar, 2) provide your own override json file, 3) properly implement the `remoteInit()` method for the exchange (please submit a pull request so the whole community can benefit) or 4) a combination of hard-coded JSON and remote API calls.
